        <p> My name is Dan Rainone and I am a physics major at the University of Rhode Island. Growing up in Cranston, RI, I graduated from <br>
            Cranston High School West in 2016. I have also attended the Community College of Rhode Island before transferring to URI. <br>
            Academically, my interests are surrounded by mathematics and problem solving. Outside of class, I enjoy playing video games, <br>
            rooting for the New England Patriots, and frequently partake in amateaur astronomy with my telescope.
